Solve for x: $4^{x + 7} = 8^{x + 3}$

- 1. Make the base (4 and 8) of the exponent the same.|
- 2. $(2^2)^{x + 7} = (2^3)^{x + 3}$ |
- 3. Merge exponents by multiplication: $2^{2\left(x + 7\right)} = 2^{3\left(x + 3\right)}$ |
- 4. Exponents with same base are equal:  $2\left(x + 7\right) = 3\left(x + 3\right)$ |
- 5. Distribute and muliply:  $2x + 14 = 3x + 9$|
- 6. Simplify and solve:  $x = 5$|

Solve for x: $16^{2x+1}=128$

Step 1
For two exponents that are equal if they have the same base, then, the exponents must be the same:

if: $2^{x} = 2^{10}$

then: $x = 10$

But the base is not the same in the question!
