- Hint 1: make the base (4 and 8) of the exponent the same.|
- Hint 2: $4^2^{x + 7} = 8^{x + 3}$ |
- Hint 3: look |
- Hint 4: look |

Solve for x: $16^{2x+1}=128$

Step 1
For two exponents that are equal if they have the same base, then, the exponents must be the same:

if: $2^{x} = 2^{10}$

then: $x = 10$

But the base is not the same in the question!
