Solve for x: $4^{x + 7} = 8^{x + 3}$

- Hint 1: make the base (4 and 8) of the exponent the same.|
- Hint 2: $(2^2)^{x + 7} = (2^3)^{x + 3}$ |
- Hint 3: Merge exponents by multiply: $2^{2\leftx + 7\right} = 2^{3\leftx + 3\right}$ |
- Hint 4: look |
- Hint 5: look |

Solve for x: $16^{2x+1}=128$

Step 1
For two exponents that are equal if they have the same base, then, the exponents must be the same:

if: $2^{x} = 2^{10}$

then: $x = 10$

But the base is not the same in the question!
